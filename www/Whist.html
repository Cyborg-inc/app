      <h3>What you need</h3>
      <br>
      <ul>
        <li>a deck of cards</li>
        <li>a flat surface to play on</li>
        <li>four players</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <h3>How to play</h3>
      <P>The cards are ranked like this(top left = highest ; bottom right= lowest)</P>
      <center><img src="http://www.wsop.com/how-to-play-poker/images/how-to-card-rank.jpg"style="width:350px;height:228px"></center>
      <p>the four players make two fixed partnerships of two<br><br>partners sit opposite each other<br><br>A dealer is randomly selected<br><br>The dealer then deals out the card so everyone has 13 cards<br><br>The final card (which will belong to the dealer)is turned face up to show which suit is the trump<br><br>The turned trump will remain face-upon the table until it is the dealer's turn to play the first trick and may play any card <br><br>the other players play a car to that trick in clockwise order (following the suit if possible)<br><br>If the player can't follow the suit they may any card to discard or trump<br><br>The highest card of the suit that was lead wins the trick<br>unless their are trump cards played in whcih case the highest rank in the trump suit wins the trick<br><br>Play continues until all 13 cards are played then the score is recorded<br></p>
      <h3>How scoring works</h3>
      <p>The side that won more tricks gets one point for each trick in excess of six<br><br>So if a team has 8 tricks they score 2 points<br><br>The first team to score 5 points wins</p>
