      <ul>
        <li>a deck of cards</li>
        <li>a flat surface to play on</li>
        <li>people play against</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <h3>How to play</h3>
      <p>Split the deck evenly amongst the players with the cards face down<br>Choose a player to go first<br>They will place a card face up in the middle and say 'one'<br>Then the next player will then place down acard face up a say 'two<br>This continues up to thirteen then the next player will place a card face up and say 'one'<br>this is repeated again and again<br>If when a card is put down it has the same value as the number said (Jack=11 Queen=12 King=13 Ace=1)Then all players must put their hands on the pile in the middle<br>The last player to put their hand in the middle must pick up the pile <br> this also happens if the two card placed in the middle has the same value as the card before it<br> whoever picked up the cards starts the next round<br>if a player says the wrong number or hits the pile when their isn't a snap has to pick up the center pile<br>When a player is out of cards they simply say the correct number when it becomes their turn without placing a card<br>The loser is the last person to still have cards </p>
